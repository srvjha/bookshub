# ðŸ“šBooksHub Project

## Features Implemented

- **Fetch Books from API**: Books are retrieved from `https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/public/books` and displayed dynamically.
- **List/Grid Toggle**: Users can switch between list and grid view for better accessibility.
- **Book Details Display**: Each book includes the title, author, publisher, published date, and a thumbnail image.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can filter books by title or author in real time.
- **Sorting Feature**: Books can be sorted alphabetically (A-Z) and by release date.
- **Pagination**: As the user scrolls, more books are loaded dynamically.
- **Detailed View on Click**: Clicking a book item opens more details in a new tab via `infoLink`.
